  title: 'Creating Sentro',
  description: 'Creating a tool to build and manage design systems at scale.'
}

This blog post has been a long time in the making. I've been working on Sentro since 2020, and it has surely grown to meet the needs of design teams and engineering teams (yes, this includes myself) that I've worked with in these past few years. I'm excited to share the story of how Sentro came to be and how it has evolved over time, as well as how it has helped teams build and manage design systems at scale, and why it might be the right tool for your team.

## Filling the need
Back in 2020, I started investing my time in creating a design system for a personal project that was growing in size. As I was working on a major refactoring of the UI, I stumbled upon resources saying how design systems can solve problems with scaling your UI. I was intrigued and started to look into design systems and how they can help me with my project.

I started creating a design system using SCSS. Architected using simple file imports, default variables, and a few helper functions. It was simple, and it worked! However, glaring problems start to popup concerning the scalability of the design system. Will this design system scale as the project grows and more people start to work on it? How can I make sure that the design system will scale even if there's a major refactoring with how the design system is structured?

## Building the right tool
After a while I've decided to refactor the design system and started working on a core module. It should be able to plug and play into any project. It should not force a specific convention, but rather foster a convention that the team can agree upon. It should not give too much, but still give the essentials. And it should be simple to use.

### Shaping the API
Early on I already have an idea on how I would want to use this. I wanted to write up something like this:
```scss
// main.scss

@use '@matteusan/core' with ($prefix: 'gs', $context: 'theme');

:root {
  @include core.theme-config(
    $primary: (
      'default': #122c53,
      'light': #536b99,
      'dark': #061021,
      'ink': #fff
    ),
    $secondary: (
      'default': #ffac00,
      'light': #ffd77e,
      'dark': #533800,
      'ink': #000
    ),
    $radius: (
      'small': 0.3rem,
      'medium': 0.5rem,
      'large': 0.7rem
    ),
  );
}

.sdc-component {
  background-color: core.key-create('component-fill', core.theme-get('primary'));
  border-radius: core.key-create('component-radius', core.theme-get('radius-medium'));
}
```

And then get something like this:

```css
/* main.css */

:root {
  --gs-theme-primary: #122c53;
  --gs-theme-primary-light: #536b99;
  --gs-theme-primary-dark: #061021;
  --gs-theme-on-primary: #fff;
  --gs-theme-secondary: #ffac00;
  --gs-theme-secondary-light: #ffd77e;
  --gs-theme-secondary-dark: #533800;
  --gs-theme-on-secondary: #000;
  --gs-theme-radius-small: 0.3rem;
  --gs-theme-radius-medium: 0.5rem;
  --gs-theme-radius-large: 0.7rem;
}

.sdc-component {
  background-color: var(--gs-component-fill, var(--gs-theme-primary));
  border-radius: var(--gs-component-radius, var(--gs-theme-radius-medium));
}
```

This already aligns with the goals I've set for the tool. It's simple to use, and it's also flexible enough to be used in any project.

### Evolution
After building the core functionality, I started to build the design system around it. And as the design system grew, so did the core's shortcomings at the time. Gradually, as I made additions to the design system, I made sure to attend to the core's needs. Token validation, breakpoint system, error handling, data validation, feature validation were all added due to the amount of needs in the design system to function.

## What happened next
After a while, I started exploring creating a personal design system for my personal projects. I tried creating one from scratch using the same approach. I then realized that instead of reinventing the wheel, I can just use the core module again and build on top of it. I mean it already has the essentials, why not use it?

Overtime as I join different teams and communities within the programming circle, I've started to get requests to develop a design system or refactor their UI for them. The core library since then has grown on me and has become an essential tool in my workflow. Its philosophies and principles are so in-line with how I code styles that I cannot stop writing that way.

I decided to publish the core module as Sentro (meaning center or core in Tagalog).

### Hashi
[Hashi](https://hashi-docs.netlify.app) is [Dev Protocol](https://devprotocol.xyz)'s design system for building cohesive interfaces and intuitive experiences that govern their ecosystem of products.

### Before Hashi
Dev Protocol's interfaces were mostly built using Tailwind CSS. It allowed the development team to move fast. Really fast. However, from auditing the UI one glaring issue is that the maintainability of their interfaces in the long term was not good. Products in their ecosystem all have different user interfaces and experiences which created a sense of fragmentation. The team's way of using Tailwind encouraged too much leniency, and promoted an unstructured way of creating interfaces. One dropdown functioned differently from the other, button variants were all over the place, feedback indicators were different from application to application. They needed something to govern and unify the experience across their products. They needed a design system.

### The solution
They wanted a design system that is framework-agnostic, can be used with plain CSS, and is based on the use of design tokens. Additionally, they still wanted to keep the freedom of using utility classes for immediate changes while still maintaining patterns and practices.

Sentro serves as the foundation of the design system. It provides the functionality to create and manage tokens, themes, keys, breakpoints, etc. Initially, it was served without abstractions. Sentro was used directly with every aspect of the design system.

<div className="mx-auto my-lg" style={{ maxWidth: '540px' }}>
  <PreviewImage src="/img/blog/creating-sentro/heirarchy-slim.png" alt="The initial implementation of Sentro in the design system." />
</div>

However, it was quickly realized that adding another abstraction layer to extend Sentro was much needed. Common patterns to color, struct, typography, etc. were made into functions and mixins to ease the development of the design system. Abstractions like `theme-merge`, `color-apply`, `struct-bind`, etc. were added as these were common patterns found in the design system.

<div className="mx-auto my-lg" style={{ maxWidth: '540px' }}>
  <PreviewImage src="/img/blog/creating-sentro/heirarchy.png" alt="The final implementation of Sentro in the design system." />
</div>

Additionally, Sentro's `token-registry-get()` feature did wonders in making sure that all the theme tokens are present in the utility classes.
